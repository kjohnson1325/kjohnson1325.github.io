								<h2 class="major">Intro</h2>
								<p>Hi, my name is Kyle Johnson and I'm excited you're viewing this page! To make a long story short, I am an engineer (working primarily in manufacturing) who is looking to transition into a data analytics career.</p>
								<p>I graduated in 2019 with a Bachelor's Degree in Chemical Engineering from Michigan Technological University. Since then I have worked in a variety of roles within the manufacturing industry, gaining experience and skills along the way. Throughout my career I have been recognized for my focus on data-driven decision making. I have consistently relied on data to help drive decisions within my teams; it has made my job much more rewarding and easier so that's a win-win! </p>
								<p>This is why I'm looking to transition into data analytics as a full-time career. For me, it has been the most interesting and rewarding part of my roles and I'm ready to go all-in and further develop my skills. To prepare for this career shift, I have completed the Google Data Analytics course on Coursera. In this course I have learned the basics of using SQL, Tableau, and R programming to assist in data analysis and visualization. In the Projects folder in this website you can find my work and see how I've put these newly acquired skills to the test!</p>
								<p>Check out my awesome work <a href="#Projects">here</a>. It isn't fancy or advanced, but it's all mine. I believe this work highlights my simple approach to solving problems and also my attention to detail.</p>

								<h3 class="major">Cyclistic Case Study</h3>
								<p>This case study is for a fictitious bikeshare company called "Cyclistic". The team at cyclistic is gearing up for a marketing campaign targeting casual members and trying to convert them to annual members, which the Finance Team has shown is signicantly more profitable for the company. The Data Analysis Team is tasked with answering the following question - "How do annual members and casual riders behave differently?" This information will be used by the Marketing Team which will then design and execute a marketing campaign to target casual riders.</p>
								<p>Since Cyclistic is not a real company, it has no real data. Luckily, there is data that is readily available from the Divvy bikeshare program in Chicago, IL. The raw data is in .csv file format and is stored in separate files for each month. The Analysis Team retreived data for one full year (July 2023 through June 2024). The raw data was cleaned, transformed, analyzed, verified, and visualized through a combination of SQL (BigQuery), Excel, and PowerPoint. The project files are shown below:</p>

								<h3 class="major">Covid-19 Data Exploration</h3>
								<p>This project is an initial exploration into COVID-19 data from January 2020 through April 2021. This data was retrieved from the World Health Organization (WHO), reporting the daily case counts and deaths around the world. The dataset was created by ourworldindata.org and can be found <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths">here</a>.</p>
								<p>The goal of this project was to complete an initial exploration of the data, sharing key insights using a data visualization. The data was imported, cleaned, transformed, and analyzed using SQL (MYSQL). Then some key tables were imported into Tableau and were used to create a dashboard. The project files are shown below:</p>

						<!-- Resume -->
							<article id="Resume">
								<h2 class="major">Resume</h2>
								<p>My most up-to-date resume can be found on my Linkedin page <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-j-60204391/">here</a>.</p>
								<p>For a summary of my Resume, here you go!</p>
								<h3 class="major">School/Career</h3>
								<p>I graduated from college in 2019 with a BS in Chemical Engineering from Michigan Technological University. I achieved Magna Cum Laude Honors, earning a 3.81 GPA. During college I did 3 internships/co-ops in the manufacturing industry, gaining meaningful experience and skills along the way. After school I was able to participate on a new start-up team as a process engineer - supporting a $400MM capital project from construction through start-up and production. Then I transitioned into a manufacturing engineer role, serving as the asset owner for 2 large production assets. After this I became the plant engineer for a packaging manufacturer - leading all engineering projects, ongoing asset support, and assisting the operations team in maximizing production. </p>
								<h3 class="major">Technical Skills</h3>
								<p>I have intermediate-advanced skills in the Microsoft Suite (Excel, Word, Powerpoint, Visio, and Project). I have beginner level skills in the following data analysis tools - SQL, Tableau, and R programming. I've completed the Google Data Analytics course on Coursera to learn these skills and have completed several projects to test and learn these tools better. I have also used Solidworks and AutoCad for 2-D and 3-D modeling in my engineering career, as well as some other internal production/database tools at each company I've worked for.</p>
								<h3 class="major">Why should you hire me?</h3>
								<p>The following are some strengths that I've been recognized for and would like to highlight. I'm a slow learner (I know it sounds a bit odd, but bear with me for a moment). This challenge has been a source of embarrassment for me personally throughout my life, but I've used it to develop what I believe are my greatest strengths. In overcoming this challenge, I've learned the value of diligence and perseverence. I've experienced that I can work towards a goal and achieve it; the only limiting factors are how much time/effort I put in and having the humility to ask for help. I have embraced being a lifelong learner, adopting a growth mindset - believing that my skills/abilities are not fixed but can be changed with effort. I am also passionate about effective interpersonal communication - growing in empathetic listening, seeking first to understand, and thinking win-win to solve complex problems and navigate difficult situations. </p>
